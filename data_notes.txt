1. Data Cleaning:
    i. pick the fields upto AR(Away Team Red Cards), not including the betting fields.  |
   ii. change the Date field data-type from str to timestamp object.   |
  iii. drop the Div field as it contains only one value SP1 denoting Spanish Premier 1.   |

    v. second_half_home_goals(SHHG) = FTHG - HTHG  |
   vi. second_half_away_goals(SHAG) = FTAG - HTAG  |

2. Form league table:
    -> based on the dataset we have, we will create the league table for 2018-19 season.   |
    -> the league table will be a dataframe which will include the following fields:

       ii. MP - Matches Played
      iii. W - Wins
       iv. D - Draws
