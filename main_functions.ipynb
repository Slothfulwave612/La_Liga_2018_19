    "\n",
    "**User Define Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***multi_table(table_list):*** This function will take a list of dataframes and will return dataframe in such a manner that they are displayed in a side by side manner in jupyter notebook.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***make_league_table(clubs,df,side):*** This function is used in three cases, firstly when preparing the league table and subsequently when preparing the home league and away league table. The function will take a list of clubs, a dataframe and side parameter to know whether we are preparing the main league table or home league or away league table. It will return a dictionary, which will contain key as the club name and value as all other parameters(like number of wins, losses, points etc.)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***fill_goals(df, home, away, title):*** This function is used to compute the average goals scored/conceded by each club. The function will take a dataframe, home parameter, away parameter and title value as parameters.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***fill_percent(df, result, title):*** This function is used for computing win, lose and draw percentage. The function will take a dataframe, result parameter and title value as parameters.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***fill_result(result_dict, param):*** This function is used for filling result based on result_dict dictionary.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ***home_away(df,home_param,away_param):*** This function is used for computing home and away wins/losses, will take a dataframe as its parameter and home_param, away_param for finding out whether the data of win has to be prepared or that of a loss.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ***goals_per_shot(df, team, shot, goal, stitle, title):*** This function will compute goals per shot/shot on target ratio. The different parameter values will give the function the information to know whether it has to preprare the ratio based on shots or shots on target.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. ***count_avg(df,side,param,title):*** This function will compute average based on the param value.\n",
